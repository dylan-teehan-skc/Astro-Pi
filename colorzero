#colorzero is a colour manipulation library that aims to be simple to use and Pythonic in nature.
colorzero makes it easy to transition between two colours:

from colorzero import Color
from sense_hat import SenseHat
from time import sleep

sense = SenseHat()

start = Color('yellow')
end = Color('cyan')

# Slowly transition the Sense HAT from the `start` to the `end` colour
for color in start.gradient(end, steps=100):
    sense.clear(color.rgb_bytes)
    sleep(0.1)
